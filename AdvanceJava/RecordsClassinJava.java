/*
 * In Java, a **record** is a special kind of class introduced in **Java 14** as
 * a preview feature and fully introduced in **Java 16**. Records are designed
 * to be a concise way to define immutable data objects, primarily intended for
 * classes that are "data carriers" — those that simply hold data without much
 * behavior or business logic.
 * 
 * ### Key Features of Java Records:
 * 1. **Concise Syntax**: Records allow you to define a class in a much more
 * concise manner compared to traditional classes. You don’t need to explicitly
 * write constructors, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, or `toString()` methods because
 * they are automatically generated by the compiler.
 * 
 * 2. **Immutable Data**: The fields in a record are final by default, meaning
 * that once the object is created, its state cannot be changed. This promotes
 * immutability, which can lead to safer and more predictable code.
 * 
 * 3. **Auto-Generated Methods**: The following methods are automatically
 * provided by the Java compiler for records:
 * - A **constructor** that takes all the fields as parameters.
 * - **Getters** for each field, named exactly as the fields.
 * - **equals()**, **hashCode()**, and **toString()** methods.
 * 
 * ### Example:
 * Here's a simple example of a Java record:
 * 
 * ```java
 * public record Point(int x, int y) {
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * This `Point` record is equivalent to the following class:
 * 
 * 
 * public class Point {
 * private final int x;
 * private final int y;
 * 
 * public Point(int x, int y) {
 * this.x = x;
 * this.y = y;
 * }
 * 
 * public int x() {
 * return x;
 * }
 * 
 * public int y() {
 * return y;
 * }
 * 
 * @Override
 * public boolean equals(Object o) {
 * if (this == o) return true;
 * if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
 * Point point = (Point) o;
 * return x == point.x && y == point.y;
 * }
 * 
 * @Override
 * public int hashCode() {
 * return Objects.hash(x, y);
 * }
 * 
 * @Override
 * public String toString() {
 * return "Point{" +
 * "x=" + x +
 * ", y=" + y +
 * '}';
 * }
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Benefits:
 * - **Simplicity**: Less boilerplate code for data classes.
 * - **Clarity**: The purpose of the class as a simple data holder is
 * immediately clear.
 * - **Immutability**: Encourages the use of immutable data objects, leading to
 * safer and more predictable code.
 * 
 * ### Limitations:
 * - **No Mutability**: Fields are final, so records are not suitable for cases
 * where object state needs to be modified.
 * - **No Inheritance**: Records cannot extend other classes, though they can
 * implement interfaces.
 * 
 * In summary, Java records are a powerful feature for creating simple,
 * immutable data-carrying classes with minimal code.
